Matlab club 28/09/16: Psychtoolbox exercisesExercise 1Open a psychtoolbox window that is smaller than the size of your screen which will close when you press any key on the keyboard.Exercise 2Open a psychtoolbox window and draw a series of squares on the screen in any arrangement you like. Try to make the squares different colours. Try to also include a way to exit the screen upon a specific keypress e.g. the escape key.Exercise 3Using the psychtoolbox functions for creating sounds, open a psychtoolbox window that once a key is pressed will play a series of beeps at different tones before closing.Exercise 4Draw a rectangle in psychtoolbox that you can move around the screen in real time with the arrow keys. Try to make it so that diagonal movements are possible. Also get it so that the screen can be closed with the escape key.Places to find help with psychtoolbox:* You can use “help function” or function(‘subfunction?’) to get help on psychtoolbox functions and subfunctions within matlab. For example, if you wanted to view the documentation on Screen you would type “help Screen”, but if you wanted help with the psychtoolbox subfunction DrawTextures you would type Screen(‘DrawTextures?’).* http://docs.psychtoolbox.org/Psychtoolbox -- the psychtoolbox wiki. This contains the same information that can be accessed through Matlab using either help or by using ?.* http://peterscarfe.com/ptbtutorials.html -- a great selection of well commented and clear demos * You can look in the psychDocumentation folder installed within your psychtoolbox folder, but some of this material is a bit complicated.* You can look in the psychDemos folder installed within the psychtoolbox folder, but some of these are not as well commented and have less obvious variable naming systems than peter scarfe’s demos, so can take a bit longer to get your head around.* If none of these options help you, you can try the psychtoolbox forum, available here: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/psychtoolbox/conversations/topics
